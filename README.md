# Twitter clone

This is a clone of twitter developed with the use of rails.

# Features/Functions

In this app, I tried to make it as close as I can with the original twitter, function wise. So far, I was able to do the basic functions of the app which is to make a personal account, make and store tweets, and view the tweets.

For the layout, I just based it on the layout of twitter in mobile and just change some of the layouts. Overall, it's actually a pretty simple layout.
